## About the Collection
From Lummi Island Foundation for Education:

This is an-in progress exhibit and repository of the history of the Lummi Beach School. Currently, our holdings are focused on the 1890s; we are in the process of analyizing and transcribing Lummi Island resident Peggy Aiston's extensive research notes. Using the Aiston archive, located at Western Washington University, we hope to piece together a primary source narrative of the development of this island institution. 

From CollectionBuilder:

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
